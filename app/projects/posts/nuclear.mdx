this is a note-taking and learning app that we're building. you can upload any file you want, have it converted and have nuclear generate notes for you. get flashcards, quizzes, and a tutor to hold your hand and guide you through learning plans.
<br><br>
oh we also have a sweet built-in text editor in all the notes, that also supports LaTeX hehe. have fun yall math nerds.
<br><br>
behind the scenes, it's me, ojas, karman, sathya, parnika.
