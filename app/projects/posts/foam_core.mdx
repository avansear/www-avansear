i was always in love with legos because they're a one size fits all solution but also somehow end up letting everyone show off their creativity.
<br><br>
so when it came to doing something with foam core, the goal was to create 7 identical stackable pieces that still worked together with all other pieces to look unique.
<br><br>
naturally my mind went to legos lol, and so i did, i literally remade legos with foam core. honestly, i thought trying to remake something that already exists would be easy but fuck, it wasn't. because i kept messing up. i completely forgot to account for the fact the top pegs need to go into the block above with a snug fit, so i had to completely remake the thing again.
<br><br>
all in all, great fucken project. loved working with foamcore. i wish i can spend all my days working in a sculpting studio. kudos to ahmed ozsever. (my sculpting prof)
