this piece is literally me. my real name’s vishruth, but online i go by “avan”. the letters “a” and “v” have been in pretty much every logo or sketch i’ve made for myself.
<br><br>
the cool thing is they’ve got really similar shapes, so i made a mold that says “a” on one side and “v” on the other.
<br><br>
i went for a serif-style look. kinda works on the bottom of the “a” and top of the “v”, but it falls apart a bit on the other ends.

this next piece out of my love for egypt. i’ve always been obsessed with how cairo has these huge modern buildings right next to ancient pyramids—such a wild contrast.
<br><br>
one half of the block is this chaotic structure with tons of shapes, and the other half is just... nothing. a plain block.
<br><br>
just wanted to show how even a simple surface can pop if you put it in the right spot.
<br><br>
everyone’s trying to think outside the box, but honestly, sometimes the box is the coolest place to be.
