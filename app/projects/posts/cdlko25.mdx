this t-shirt design, obviously heavily inspired from the work me and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hopeinmyeyes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">ankita</a> did on the codeday kolkata 2024 tshirt, took me 18 fucking hours.
<br><br>
all of the vectors are hand drawn- WITH A MOUSE LMAO- coz mouse feels better idk, it always has. the ducks in each puzzle piece though, were made by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ananyasrvvv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">ananya</a>.
