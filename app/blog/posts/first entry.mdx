i only usually use figma but lately idk it's kinda fun to use vscode, github, and vercel to do stuff. i've been doing small stuff for nuclear here and there but honestly, this shit looks fun. i know i can already do crazy fucking stuff on figma, but aaaaa what if i can do both? shit, that would be fucking awesome.
